TODO:

 * add a trickle-down-flag "sortby" for ordering task-all, task-show, task-print results
 * add a trickle-down-flag "display" for showing selected fields only for task-all, task-show, task-print results
 * add constraints/error-checks e.g.
   - in (task-add) don't add items to blocks/blockedby/parent/children unless type == '(+Task)
   - check things are set/compared appropriately as transient-syms "XX" instead of intern-syms 'XX
 * add worklog/history (and ability to view timeline of changes)
 * add "STDIN-handling" to commandline mode (presently interactive or cmdline args only)
 * copy/adapt web frontend logic from demo addressbook app on wiki
