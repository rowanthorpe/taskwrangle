Picotask

Copyright Â© 2016 Rowan Thorpe. Initially based entirely on a "taskdb" demo-app
posted by Joe Bognor at [the Picolisp wiki](http://picolisp.com/wiki/?taskdb) on 24 August 2016, and
intended to develop extensively from there.

Rationale
---------

I was frustrated by various task-management systems I gave up on over the years
(mainly due to them being over-engineered for my needs, and never having the
time to become a "task-management guru" just to have a hierarchical TODO
system). From those experiences and some good takeaways from working with
trouble-ticket and project-management systems over the years, I know very much
what I want in a personal task-management system, and more importantly - what I
*don't* want. For that reason, when Joe Bognor posted a mini task-management
demo-app on the Picolisp site I got enthusiastic while playing with it and
developed it to the point that I found useful as a real-world app. For the sake
of getting input from others (and in case anyone else would like to use it)
I've uploaded it.
